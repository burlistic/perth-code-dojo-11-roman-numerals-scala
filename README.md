# perth-code-dojo-11-roman-numerals-scala

For this months code dojo we tried out a new technique and a new langauge (Scala)

We did the roman numerals kata - orginally taken from http://www.codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataRomanNumerals

# Roman Numerals Kata

The Romans were a clever bunch. They conquered most of Europe and ruled it for hundreds of years. They invented concrete and straight roads and even bikinis.
One thing they never discovered though was the number zero.
This made writing and dating extensive histories of their exploits slightly more challenging, but the system of numbers they came up with is still in use today.

The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M. (notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack into stone tablets).
Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals: eg
  1 --> I
  10 --> X
  7 --> VII

There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000. (The Romans themselves didn't tend to go any higher)

## The challange

Build an application that converts Roman Numerals to numbers. Write unit tests and left the solution evolve.

## Considerations

* Can you make the code really beautiful and highly readable?
* Does it help to break out lots of small named functions from the main function, or is it better to keep it all in one function?
* Does the order you take the tests in effect the final design of your algorithm?
* Would it be better to work out an algorithm first before starting with TDD?
* What are the best data structures for storing all the numeral letters? (I, V, D, M etc)
* What is the best way to verify your tests are correct?
